# CodeClause_Time_Conversion_by_Country
This is the first project of my CodeClause Java Development Internship, Time Conversion by Country. It takes the continent name &amp; the city name of a country to display the time of that city/country.

To run the program in VS Code, first download the Java VS Code Extension by Microsoft. And then run using F5, or navigating to the run button by selecting the program file. Thank you!
